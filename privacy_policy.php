                    Thank you for visiting us at <a href="index.php"> TechZone</a>. We have ensured the privacy and security of your activities and transactions with us. Your information and other data given during the order process will be guarded with the highest levels of security and confidentiality.<br><br>

                  <b style="font-size:20px;">    Secure Shopping</b><br>
                    The information for all orders placed on our site is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) technology, so your transactions are completely protected. With SSL in place for both the client and the server, the information sent via the Internet will arrive securely (encrypted) via an SSL-enabled browser as most internet browsers today are equipped with SSL. To be sure your connection is secure when filling out the order form, simply check for the padlock icon, which can be visible beside the address bar on most browsers.<br><br>

                   <b style="font-size:20px;">  Your Privacy Online</b><br>
                   TechZone respects privacy of internet users and does not collect personally identifying information without permission from the user. Information that customers provide while opening account on TechZone is NOT used for any purpose other than core activities of TechZone as an online store (product delivery, contacting customers etc.). TechZone does't sell or supply any information of any customer to any 3rd party entity.<br><br>

                    Activities of visitors on TechZone and its sub-directories (pages and products viewed, comments, ratings etc.) can be monitored and recorded. This information will be used for generating statistical data as well as improving the website & user experience and will never be provided to any 3rd party entity. Information regarding usage of the website of a user, who has registered for a TechZone account, might be used for sending marketing content(s) to the user.<br><br>

                    Information provided while placing an order will be handled according to the policy in effect at the time of the order. From time to time we may change our policies, and any such changes will be reflected in these policy statements. Concerned customers should review these statements for changes when revisiting the site.<br><br>

                   <b style="font-size:20px;">   Digital Payment Security:</b><br>
                   TechZone doesnâ€™t collect any information related to online banking account of a customer while the customer makes digital payment (through bKash, credit/debit card etc.). The field/window where customers put online banking credentials is entirely provided by the respective online banking authority or trusted 3rd party merchant(s) and TechZone has access to NO information on that field/window. As an extra layer of security, each transaction is accompanied by a unique OTP (one time password), which is sent to the customers by their respective online banking authority and is mandatory to complete any digital payment.
