                <b style="font-size:20px;"> What is TechZone</b><br>
                Techshopbd is one sort of your constant helping hand on whom you can rely, with no doubt, for any technological support and related assistance. To be more precise, it is an online retail store that sells the electronic bits and pieces needed for a competent electronic project. We don't discriminate among the bits and pieces on their sizes and range of use. Everything, that has even a minimum use at the project, is also considered with equal significance. <br><br>

                Our ultimate vision is to release the tension, of the enthusiastic researchers, about the availability of the necessary devices and make electronics reach to the limit of the average persons. <br><br>

                However, our endeavors are not confined within selling and reaching electronics only, we also offer essential tutorials on diversified projects and according to the demand of the researchers this sector is updated time to time. We dream of building up skilled individuals who will flourish our country through the innovation of unforeseen electronic devices and also of acquainting people with the wonderful world of embedded electronics.<br><br>

                <b style="font-size:20px;">  Who We Are?</b><br>
                Our identity is quite auspicious, we are Techfreak. We are a group of freak people, albeit the term 'freak' must be considered in positive sense. Freak is defined as someone who is so ardently devoted to something that it resembles an addiction. And our freakiness goes to technology. We are like other common people, but what makes us different is the intense zeal towards technology which has brought us under common platform.<br><br>

                No matter whether you are a student, engineer, doctor, cricketer, professor, lawyers, or even vagabond or having whatever professional background, if you love and think of technology, you are one of us. We are spread around you....<br><br>

                <b style="font-size:20px;">  Behind-the-Scenes</b><br>
                There is no shortage of talent in our country, but shortage of electronic device is always an unresolved question, which demoralizes thousands of enthusiastic individuals. If this shortcoming could have managed somehow, the practice of research must have been geared up and we believed that this task will not be so tough.<br><br>

                From this motivation, we took the responsibility of enduring all hap hazards faced in case of collecting electronic devices, and time has come to claim our success to that commitment. Now, you can buy any device which was almost impossible for you just a few days ago.
